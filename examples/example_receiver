receiver.py DUMBNO-QUEUE-NAME localhost 9000

DUMBNO-QUEUE-NAME and localhost needs to match whats in your .cfg file
port 9000 will be what the reeciver lists on for updates from Bro.  Set Bro to 9000 as well.

You can change the port to support multiple Bro instances sending to the same Dumbno host.  Just use a different port # and queuename for the second Bro instance.
